## Overview

This project is a Todo List application built using React. It allows users to add, edit, prioritize, mark as completed, and delete tasks. The user interface is designed to be responsive, with a layout optimized for both desktop and mobile devices. Tasks can be added with a title and priority level (low, medium, high). Users can mark tasks as completed, edit task titles and priorities, and delete tasks. The application also stores tasks locally using browser localStorage.
